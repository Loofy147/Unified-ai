## Red Team Adversarial Testing Framework

The Unified AI System includes a comprehensive Red Team Adversarial Testing Framework designed to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the system. This framework uses a variety of attack vectors to simulate real-world threats and ensure the system is robust and resilient.

The framework is located in the `red_team_framework.py` file and can be run from `main.py` or as part of the test suite.
